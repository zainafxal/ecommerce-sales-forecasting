# üìö Project Summary ‚Äî E-Commerce Sales Forecasting

This file summarizes the key steps and logic in the main notebook (`ecommerce-sales-forecasting.ipynb`) and the deployed Streamlit app.

---

## **1. Project Overview**
- **Objective:** Forecast product sales for an e-commerce platform using historical data, to optimize inventory, marketing, and profitability.
- **Why:** Accurate sales forecasts are crucial for business efficiency‚Äîoverstocking wastes money, stockouts lose sales, and marketing can be better timed.

---

## **2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

### 2.1 About Dataset
- **What:** Describes the dataset (Online Retail), its columns, and their meanings.
- **Why:** Understanding the data‚Äôs structure and business context is the foundation for all further analysis.

### 2.2 Import Libraries
- **What:** Imports pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, plotly, scipy, and others.
- **Why:** These are essential tools for data manipulation, visualization, and statistical analysis.

### 2.3 Data Overview
- **What:** Loaded the data, checked shape, columns, data types, missing values, and duplicates.
- **Why:** Know what you‚Äôre working with, plan for cleaning, and avoid bias.

### 2.4 Univariate Analysis
- **Quantity, UnitPrice, Country, StockCode, Description, CustomerID:**  
  Checked for missing values, outliers, unique values, and visualized distributions.
- **Why:** Spot errors, outliers, and understand feature distributions.

### 2.5 Bivariate & Multivariate Analysis
- **What:** Aggregated and plotted monthly sales, scatter plot and correlation analysis.
- **Why:** Identify seasonality, relationships, and inform feature engineering.

---

## **3. Action-Based EDA & Data Cleaning**
- **What:** Filtered for valid sales, removed returns/cancellations, non-product codes, and handled missing values.
- **Why:** Focus on real sales, remove noise, and ensure data integrity.

---

## **4. Feature Engineering & Hypothesis Generation**
- **What:** Created financial, time-based, RFM, and product-level features. Applied log transformation to Quantity.
- **Why:** Add predictive power, capture business logic, and reduce skewness.

---

## **5. Final Data Overview & Hypotheses**
- **What:** Summarized cleaned data, saved to file, and generated hypotheses for modeling.
- **Why:** Ensure readiness for modeling and guide what to test.

---

## **6. Modeling**

### 6.1 Data Preparation for Modeling
- **What:** Loaded cleaned data, capped outliers, merged features, handled missing values, defined X/y, preprocessing, and time-series split.
- **Why:** Prevent leakage, enrich data, and maintain chronological order.

### 6.2 Model Training and Evaluation
- **What:** Trained LightGBM and XGBoost, evaluated with MAE, RMSE, R¬≤.
- **Why:** Robust models for high-cardinality data, clear error metrics.

### 6.3 Hyperparameter Tuning
- **What:** Used RandomizedSearchCV with TimeSeriesSplit to tune XGBoost.
- **Why:** Find best model settings, realistic validation.

### 6.4 Saving the Final Model
- **What:** Saved the tuned model as a .pkl file.
- **Why:** Enables deployment and reuse.

---

## **7. Model Evaluation & Interpretation**

### 7.1 Feature Importance
- **What:** Analyzed which features the model relied on most.
- **Why:** Shows what drives sales, informs business strategy.

### 7.2 Performance Visualization and Error Analysis
- **What:** Plotted actual vs. predicted, residuals, and time-series performance.
- **Why:** Visual checks for bias, variance, and systematic errors.

---

## **8. Business Interpretation**
- **What:** Translated model results into actionable business insights.
- **Why:** Shows how the model can improve inventory, marketing, and operations.

---

## **9. Conclusion and Next Steps**
- **What:** Summarized the project, key learnings, and future improvements.
- **Why:** Documents what worked, what didn‚Äôt, and how to improve further.

---

## **10. Recommendations for the Business**
- **What:** Provided clear, actionable steps for deploying and using the model.
- **Why:** Ensures the project leads to real business impact.

---

## **11. Limitations & Assumptions**
- **What:** Acknowledged model boundaries and suggested future work.
- **Why:** Sets realistic expectations and a roadmap for improvement.

---

## **12. Tools, Libraries, and Project Summary**
- **What:** Listed tools, folder structure, and summarized outcomes.
- **Why:** Makes it easy for others to understand and build on your work.

---

## **13. Streamlit App Section**

### **What:**
- Developed a user-friendly Streamlit web app (`app/app.py`) for real-time sales forecasting.
- App allows users to input product, transaction, and customer details, and get instant sales quantity predictions.
- Includes currency conversion, clear input guidance, and professional UX.

### **Why:**
- Makes the model accessible to non-technical users and business stakeholders.
- Demonstrates deployment skills and ability to build interactive ML products.
- Enhances portfolio value with a live, shareable demo.
